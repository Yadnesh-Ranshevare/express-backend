**Functional Programming (FP) is a programming paradigm where you build programs using pure functions and avoid shared state or mutable data. Instead of telling the computer how to do things step by step (like in imperative programming), you describe what to do using functions. FP emphasizes declarative style, immutability, and higher-order functions.**

Hereâ€™s a simple breakdown of functional programming techniques:
1. [Higher Order Function](./HigherOrderFunction/Readme.md)
2. [Pure & Impure Function](./PureAndImpureFunction/readme.md)
3. [Side Effect](./SideEffects/readme.md) 
4. [Lazy and Eager Evaluation](./LazyAndEagerEvaluation/Readme.md)
5. [Functional Composition & Method chaining](./FunctionalCompositionAndMethodChaning/Readme.md)
6. [Immutability & Declarative Programming](./ImmutabilityDeclarativeProgramming/Readme.md)
