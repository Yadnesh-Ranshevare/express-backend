it use for token based authentication
for more details:-
https://jwt.io/



jwt is use to create the token out of the user data using the secrete key 
syntax for encoding the token:-
    jwt.sign( payload,secreteKey )

    payload:- content from user data on the basis of witch the token will from
    secreteKey:- a sequence of random character 
    
this method will encode the payload


we can also verify that the token was right or not
syntax for decoding the token:- 
    jwt.verify( token,secreteKey )

    token:- it is token created by the .sign method 
    secreteKey:- it is the same key we use for encoding the token

this method will return the payload and a timestamp( at what time that token is form )  



NOTE:-
    1. secreteKey is a top secrete component of the code if it get leaked anyone can manipulate tha data therefore we need to initialize this key inside the .env file
    2. in payload we can give as much data as you want but in mongodb _id is more than enough as a payload
