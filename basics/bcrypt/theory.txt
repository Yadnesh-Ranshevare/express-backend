bcrypt is a nodejs package to encrypt the data 

syntax for encoding:-
    bcrypt.hash( data,hash_round )

    data:- data you want to encrypt
    hash_round:- when you are hashing your data, the module will go through a series of rounds to give you a secure hash

this method will return the promise with the encrypted data as a callback

syntax for comparing the encode data with original:-
    bcrypt.compare( encryptedData,originalData )

    this decode the encryptedData into its original form and compare it with originalData and return the true or false 

NOTE:- 
    1. we use this package to encrypt the password in database
    2. this methods may take some time to execute or may failed so we write them in async function with try cath( this is not compulsory though )
